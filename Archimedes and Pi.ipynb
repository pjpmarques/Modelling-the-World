    "# Archimedes and Pi\n",

    "Since high school I've been fascinated with $\\pi$ -- this infinite non-repeating irrational transcendent number. In fact, not only was I fascinated with $\\pi$ but I was fascinated about everything related to it. In 11th grade I asked my math teacher about how to deduce the area of a circle. Her answer: for that you need to learn how to integrate – wait until university. But I couldn't wait and head to the library where I found a single book that talked about the subject – an obscure calculus book by an author named [Piskunov]( https://archive.org/details/DifferentialAndIntegralCalculus_109). And, to integrate I've learned – just because of $\\pi$. But I digress. ..\n",
    "\n",
    "This story is not about calculus or \"symbolic\" integration. It's about how [Archimedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) calculated $\\pi$ circa 200 B.C. In the \"Measurement of a Circle\" Archimedes states that: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \n",
    "> \"The ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter is greater than $3\\tfrac{10}{71}$ but less than $3\\tfrac{1}{7}$\"\n",
    "> \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first really accurate estimation of $\\pi$. I.e., he calcuated $3.140845070422535 < \\pi < 3.142857142857143$. A good approximation of $\\pi$ is 3.141592653589793. So, this is two decimal places correct. That's pretty impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the story, Archimedes did this by inscribing and circumscribing a circle with regular polygons and measuring their perimeter. As the number of sides increases, the better these polygons approximate a circle. In the end Archimedes was using a 96-sided polygon. The next image illustrates the idea.\n",

This triangle has a hypotenuse of $s_{n+1}$, an adjacent side of $s_n/2$ and a height of $h$. Note that the new polygon that we are forming is going to have eight sides (i.e., double the number of sides we had), each one measuring $s_{n+1}$. From this we can write:\n",

    "These two relations will always apply as we contantly break the polygons into smaller polygons.

What this means is that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P_n = 2 \\pi $. \n",
